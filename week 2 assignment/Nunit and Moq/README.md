Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of unit testing in C# using the NUnit testing framework along with the Moq library for mocking dependencies. The purpose of this assignment is to validate the correctness of application logic through isolated, repeatable, and automated tests.

It includes:

Unit testing simple business logic (MathUtility)
Testing service-dependent classes (TaxCalculator) using Moq
Using Assert statements for validation
Ensuring logic correctness without real implementations

This project forms part of the Deepskilling Module â€“ NUnit and Moq in Cognizant's Digital Nurture 4.0 learning track.
